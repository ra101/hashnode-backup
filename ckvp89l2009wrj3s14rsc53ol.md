Hi üñê,
This post is about the half-day builds! These projects will never be featured anywhere, So why not create a combined thread for them.


<br>**Draw Graphs in C++**
I was looking for a graphics.h project, One day my friend asked me "Did you ever come across any code which Draws the given input graph?", I replied... wait-for-it!

<br>**Pinger** (Python)
One of my deployed college project got shut down. This Script executes at startup, starts a headless browser, and open the various sites declared within. All in the background.

<br>**lbry VLC Extension** (Lua)
I was looking for a dark theme for VLC and I found out that people can create extensions that can be attached to the final build binary! This extension enables us to network streams free lbry.tv videos.

A Flutter Trial App, It changes Text to Morse Code and then allows to vibrate the phone or to flicker torch accordingly.

A Chrome-Extension that adds a button to open the current search with DuckDuckGo. You can also attach a Key-Binding to use it.
